TODO implementation:

- Add the check with the current player even if the current player is not being involved, so that no one else than the
current player really can make transactions at her turn (check for "being allowed to run this transaction on your quota")
- Add passwords checks

- Goal of the work was unclear
- Idea to fix the two previous: maybe a system diagram with arrows pointing at parts of the system
and with names of the security concerns that arise on this part of the system (that would be described later
in the paper)

Real life security use cases often include multiple parties talking to each other and making basic contracts between each  other. A
contract can take several forms: A contract between two programs about how they are going to communicate,  a contract  between two
business men about a deal between their respective companies,  etc. .  In this paper, we are going to focus on contracts that can be
modeled as _transactions_ sequences. More specifically, we are going to do a case study using the Downsizing Game invented by <!--
\cite{downgame} -->. The Downsizing Game puts in place multiple players that are all pursuing the same goal of maximizing their own
profit. Two players can make transactions between each other in order to trade every sort of resources that is available in the game. The
goal of the case study is to see what are the steps to put in place a judging party that will enforce security protocol related to
cheating  prevention and what are the security requirements we can add on top of the functional requirements. Thorough our work setting
up such a system and environment, we will report on the issues we face, the solutions we find and the decision we make with the
justifications  for such choices.

# Introduction

## The Downsizing Game 

The Downsizing Game, as originally described by S. Kaitani <!--\cite{downgame} -->, puts multiple players into an
environment where they are given a million of the local currency and have to return it at the end of the game, but they
can keep the remainder if they managed to make some profit. There are voting rounds where they vote for the other
players. The player getting the maximum amount of votes wins a one million prize while the one with the least amount of
votes is removed from the group (the group is _downsized_, giving the name to the game).

Players can maximize their profit either by trading resources with other players, or win the one million prize.

Two players can make transactions between each other in order to trade every sort of resources that is available in the
game:  Money, trust, loyalty, and votes.

The game is overseen by a _judging party_, also called _game master_. Its role in the original game is to make sure that
nobody is cheating and everything in the game happens according to the game's rules. {TODO: CHECK EXACTLY WHAT IT DOES IN
THE MANGA}

We will describe the exact instance of the game that we will use (with variations in the rules) in details in
[][gamerules].

Although it may seem like a simple game, it poses interesting challenges in terms of security because players will
almost certainly try to cheat in order to win the game and maximize their profit.

### Example
We will take a short example on a very small instance of the Downsizing Game to show the game's dynamics. 

_Note that our instance used for the case study and described in [][gamerules] will differ in some details to this example (voting rounds, especially), but we keep the example simplistic for now._

Let us imagine we have 3 players, 6 rounds, 3 voting rounds (every 2 rounds) and every player can vote for only one
other player on each voting round.

The following actions are one of the possible runs of the game (currency is \$ here):

1. Player1 is the current player. Player1 sells 1 vote to Player2 for \$100,000.
2. Voting round. Player2 votes for player 1 to respect the transaction. Player3 votes for Player2, Player1 votes for Player3. Scores are now 1 for everyone.
3. Player2 is the current player and buys Player1 1 vote and Player3 1 vote for \$25,000 each.
4. Voting round. Player2 receives 2 votes from players 1 and 3. Player3 receives a vote from Player2. Scores are 
now respectively 1, 3 and 2 for players 1, 2 and 3.
5. Player3 tries to buy votes from the two other players for \$500,000 each, Player2 accepts but Player1 refuses.
6. Voting round. Player2 votes for Player3 to respect the transaction. Player3 votes for Player1. Player1 finally still votes for Player3. Scores are now respectively respectively 2, 3 and 4 for players 1, 2 and 3.

The Player3 is the only winner and gets the one million prize.
All players then have to give back the orignal one million. Player1 cannot and has a debt of $75,000. Player2 gives  it back and keeps the \$450,000 remaining. Player3 has a debt of \$475,000 but wins the one million prize and thus make a profit of \$525,000 in the end.

## Objective

The objective, in this paper, is to use the Downsizing Game as an example to study the process of a small-sized 
software development project that would start with functional requirements and then add security requirements.

We want to build a platform to allow players to play the Downsizing Game but we do not want any cheaters.

Thorough our design and implementation, we will report on the issues we faced and the solutions and decisions we took to 
overcome them, along with the justifications of such choices. We think this material can be of some interest to computer 
science students or beginners in providing them with a concrete and detailed example.

The work is split into 3 main steps:

1. Functional requirements: design & implementation
2. Security requirements: design & implementation 
3. Comparison against existing coding guidelines (see [_Roadmap_][Roadmap])

In step 2 above (_Security requirements: design & implementation_), we will define and describe security requirements that we found, by intuition, necessary to be added.

By "by intuition", we mean here: simply thinking about the different cases that will be faced in the game and what could
be attempted by player to cheat on  the game and what should be done to ensure those cheating attempts will fail.

In step 3 above (_Comparison against existing coding guidelines_), we will compare our already security-aware (thanks to
_step 2_) application to coding guidelines. We will conclude on what we were able to fulfill or not of those guidelines
by ourselves (that is to say, before reading them). We will also analyze what, in the guidelines, applies to our program
and what does not. Finally, we'll discuss what it would have changed it we had followed guidelines since the beginning.

We will look at the last step as a partial answer to the question "How secure can I code?".

# Case Study [cs]

## Assumptions

In our design and implementation of the Downsizing Game, we will start from the following assumptions:

1. The communication channels, e.g. between the players and the [judging party][judge], are secure
2. Everything is happening in the same process on a single CPU machine. That is to say: only one instruction can be executed 
at a time, there is no parallelism/concurrency.
3. The technology used to develop the game prevents arbitrary memory from being read. A player program will thus only be 
allowed to access data from objects it has been given an explicit pointer and/or reference to.

The reason for working under those assumptions is that we focus here on the security of the interaction protocol between
players and the implementation of the judging party. A communication layer would bring with  it all sorts of communication-
related security concerns that are not of interest here. The same reason goes for parallelism  and/or concurrency.

## Functional Requirements

The functional requirements are the set of features that our instance of the Downsizing Game should implement/respect.

### Game's rules [gamerules]

The rules of _our instance_ of the Downsizing Game will be stated as follows:

- The game has a fixed length of 1,000 rounds.
- 3 players participate in the game.
- Players can only participate once in the game.
- Valid / tradable _resources_ are votes, score and the game currency.
- Every player is given a million units of the game currency (let us call it dollars) and 10 votes to cast.
- Every player starts with a score of zero.
- At the end of the game, every player must return the original one million dollars that she was given in the beginning, 
she can keep the remainder of the money for her.
- At the end of the game, if players cannot give back the entire amount of money that they were given in the beginning, 
they have contracted a debt that they will have to reimburse.
- Two players can make transactions between each other using every available resource in the game.
- A judging party enforces the game's rules and manages transactions, ensuring their validity and preventing players 
from cheating.
- There are 10 voting rounds: rounds 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 and 1,000.
- All players must vote on voting rounds.
<!--% Note: I chose 1 vote because if we have 3 players and 2 votes, then they are forced to vote for everyone...-->
- Players must cast exactly 1 vote at every voting rounds.
- Players can not vote for themselves.
- Every time a player receives a vote, his _score_ increases by 1.
- At the end of the game, the player(s) with the highest score win(s). The one(s) with the lowest score lose(s).
- The winning player(s) earn(s) 1 million dollars (evenly split, if multiple winners).
- If a player is banned (because of cheating), she has to return the money she was given at the beginning as well. If she cannot, she is considered as having a debt, as if she had finished the game with a debt.
<!-- 
\vspace{1\baselineskip}
-->
As a consequence of these rules, here are some examples of possible basic strategies:

- A player can try to get the maximum amount of votes, in order to be the winner, thus maximizing profit by getting the 
winning prize.
- A player can try to maximize its profit, without caring about votes. She will not win, but will still make profit out 
of the game, as she will keep the remainder of the money after giving back the original one million dollars.

### Definitions & needed features

#### Judging party [judge]
The judging party is a neutral (not affiliated with any player) entity whose responsability is to maintain order in the
game and make sure nobody is attempting to cheat and that, to the extent of its knowledge, every transaction is valid.

#### Current player
Players play on a turn-by-turn basis. We will call _current player_ the player of which it is currently the turn.

#### Rounds [roundsdef]

A _round_ is an atomic unit of time in the game. A round can thus not be divided into subrounds. A round passes every time 
any of the following actions is executed:

- A transaction is applied
- Changing the current player
- Applying the result of a voting round (see [_Voting rounds_][votingrounds])

#### Voting rounds [votingrounds]

A voting round is a round where, **before** any action, all players will be asked to vote as described in the game's rules.

According to the definition of the rounds, no other actions can be taken during a voting round, as a round passes when
applying the result of a voting round.

#### Vote
Vote is a special resource that can only be transferred during a voting round.

#### Resources

A _resource_ is an integer quantity that the judging party allows to trade.
In our case study, the set of resources will be fixed at the beginning of the game, to:

- Cash/money/currency
- Votes
- Score

#### Score

The _score_ of a player is increased by 1 for every vote that is casted from another player for this player.

Players can also trade their score as a _resource_. The initial score is zero ([see rules][gamerules]).


#### Cheater

<!-- 
% Note: This is on the edge between security requirement and functional requirement. But I would still say it is a
% functional requirement because the concept of "cheater" by itself and the fact cheaters should be punished is
% necessary for the game itself, it does not, imho, represent a specific security check 
-->

A cheater is a player that breaks one or several game's rules. Cheaters must be immediately banned and thus removed
from the game. Banned players cannot participate in the game anymore. As such, they will not be able to use the game
again to purge their debt if they have some.

#### Transactions

A _transaction_ is one or multiple transfer(s) of _fixed amounts_ of resources between two _identified/authenticated_
(see [][playerauth]) players. The player _sending_ the resource will later be referred to either as the _sending player_
or _paying player_ or _payer_ or _sender_. The player _receiving_ the resource will later be referred to either as the
_receiving player_ or  _paid player_ or _payee_ or _recipient_.

A transaction can either be unidirectional, that is to say, a player transfers some resource to another player and that is
all, or bidirectional. In the latter case, two players transfer resources to each other.

A bidirectional transaction is composed (in the OOP meaning) of two unidirectional transactions. A bidirectional is **not**
a special unidirectional transaction (it does not inherit from it).

Every resource except _voting promises_ can be traded using a transaction. Voting promises have to be traded using 
_voting promises transactions_ [ ][votepromtrans]

#### Amount
An _amount_ is a defined, positive integer, quantity of a single resource.

#### Immediate transactions

_Immediate_ transactions are the basic transactions: As soon as the transaction is validated, the transfer(s) of resources
is/are applied.

As a consequence, when a player agrees on an _immediate_ transaction, she is assured that the transaction will be fulfilled
if it's validated by the judging party.

#### Delayed/scheduled transactions

_Scheduled_ or _delayed_ transactions are transactions where some transfer(s) of resources is/are not immediate.

A delayed transaction is a transaction with an additional information about an **absolute game time unit**. The amount in this
_delayed_ transaction has to be completely transferred (strictly) _before_ this absolute game time unit.

Just like immediate transactions, delayed transactions can be either _unidirectional_ or _bidirectional_. A bidirectional
transaction is said to be _delayed_ or _scheduled_ if and only if at least one of the two unidirectional transactions it is
composed of, is a delayed transaction.

#### Voting promises transactions [votepromtrans]

Voting promises are a type of delayed transactions. Voting promises are promises that a given player will cast a given
number of votes to the _recipient_ of the transaction before a given absolute game's time unit (because it's a delayed
transaction).

#### Valid transaction 

A _transaction_ is said to be _valid_ if and only if: 

- Transaction does not break a game rule. 
- Transaction is able to be completed to the extent of the judging party‚Äôs knowledge. (e.g.: Enough money on the account, 
in case of an immediate money transfer).

A bidirectional transaction will be considered valid if both unidirectional transactions it is composed of are valid. If
any of them is not, then the bidirectional transaction is also invalid.

## Security Requirements

Now that we have defined functional requirements, we are going to define and describe the addition _security requirements_ 
that are necessary to ensure the players do not exploit singularities of the game in order to achieve
behaviours that should not be achieved according to the rules.

### Game state alteration

The judging party must be the only one allowed to alter the state of the game (including applying transactions). Players
talk to it when they want to make a transaction and it validates (or invalidates) it and applies it (or refuses it).

The _game state_ here refers to the balances of all players (including scores), the current round number, the history of
transactions and the state of all transactions in the history.

### Judging party neutrality

The judging party must not be manipulated by players in any way in order to achieve its neutrality. Players should not
be able to alter the state of the judging party or tamper with any of its internal data.

### Resources accounting protection

We cannot let the players update by themselves the amount of resources as they would obviously cheat and generate for
instance new cash flow so that they keep buying and making profits. We should have something managing the resources
accounting.

### Judging party exclusiveness aka turn-by-turn enforcement

The _current player_ must be the only one that can make calls to the judging party's interface.

This is needed in order to prevent other players from trying to steal the CPU and make transactions on the transaction quota
of another player instead of their own quota. We should thus implement a way to protect the judging party from executing
actions calls by other players than the _current player_.

<!-- 
% Note: Better solution?  If we want to divide it equally we need to do it with some sort of incremental algorithm: first 
% try to divide equally,  then,  sum up the amount of money that remain after taking into account the exact debt amounts,  
% in case any debt amount was smaller than the balance divided equally,  then re-directed this balance equally,  and so on 
% until there is either no debt left or no money left...
-->

### Immediate transactions: guaranteeing "immediateness" (atomicity) [immatom]

There should be no other interactions, no changes to the state of the game should happen between validation and application of an
immediate transaction.

This is partially guaranteed by the assumptions of no parallelism/concurrency. Although, a player program could still manage
to steal the CPU (effectively pausing the judging party program's execution) and try to change the state of the game by
submitting other transactions for instance. A player could use such an attack to submit multiple transactions that will be
validated on the same balances, but executed on different balances (race-condition/"TOCTTOU" <!-- \cite{tocttou} -->).

### Delayed/scheduled transactions completion [schedtranscompletion]

Delayed transactions are validated without the transfers of resources actually taking place and have a deadline for this
transfer to happen. There should a mechanism in place to that the transfer was indeed done strictly before the deadline.

### Players authentication [playerauth]

When creating a transaction, a player could provide false information about the participants in this transaction and thus
attempt to impersonate other players and make transactions on their behalf.

As a consequence, we need a mechanism to authenticate the players and be sure that the player who submitted a request in her
name, is indeed the player she is saying she is.

# Implementation 

In this section, we will first describe parts of the implementation related to enforcing the _security requirements_ and 
then present the remaining of the implementation's details.

## Security requirements implementation

### Resources accounting

The accounting of the resources of all players will entirely be hidden from the players and be done exclusively by the judging party.

Players will be given their initial amount of resources and it will be left up to them to then track their resources  if
they need to. The judging party's interface will not include anything to read the resources / balances of any players.

The judging party, before the instantiation of the players, will instantiate every player's resources. As every
transaction has to go through the judging party, it will also be the one responsible for updating the resources balances.

This way, we do not need any access control mechanism for the players, they do not have any knowledge about the
"real" accounts and as a consequence, no access to it (as they cannot access objects without reference to them, as per
[][Assumptions])

### Judging party exclusiveness aka turn-by-turn enforcement

In order to allow only the current player to access the judging party and make call to it, we will simply keep track of the current player in the judging party and every judging party's interface function will check whether the calling player is the current player or not and immediately abort if not. Player [authentication][playerauth] guarantees that another player cannot submit 
transactions by using the _current player_ as the origin of the transaction.

### Immediate transactions: guaranteeing "immediateness" (atomicity) [immatomimpl]
As explained in [][immatom], even with the stated [assumptions][Assumptions], there is still room for a race-condition.

To avoid this, we will make use of synchronization tools to only allow one concurrent execution of the judging
party program's code of validation and application of an immediate transaction. This can be materialized for instance by the use of
operating system's _mutex_ tools, but any other synchronization tool providing equal guarantees can be used too.

### Delayed/scheduled transactions completion [schedtranscompletionimpl]

When the game's clock ticks to this absolute time unit (the deadline), it will tell the judge that there is some delayed transactions that
should be checked for having been completed. The judging party will then check if the transactions have been completed by the
players participating in the scheduled transaction.  Checks for completion of delayed transaction will **always** be
performed **before any other action** can be taken in the current round. If the player that was supposed to transfer the
resources did not transfer the exact amount of resources it was supposed to, this player will be considered a cheater.

Note that in order to guarantee that the current player is not able to talk to the judging party before the end of the
delayed transactions checks, we will once more make use of synchronization tools, as in the case of  immediate transactions
[atomicity][immatom].

But in order to be able to tell the difference between transfers of resources related to new deals between two players and
transfers of resources related to completion of a scheduled/delayed transaction, we need an additional, special type of
transaction. We will call it "subtransaction".
<!-- 
\vspace{1\baselineskip}
-->
A **subtransaction** is an **immediate** transaction that contains an additional information about the delayed transaction
is it related to.

When the judging party has to check that the delayed transaction was indeed completed, it will go through all
subtransactions that were made since the round of the delayed transaction between the same two players and sum everything
up. The sum has to be **exactly** what was initially agreed in the delayed transaction. If and only if it is the case, 
then the transaction can be marked as completed.

### Players authentication [playerauthimpl]

To authenticate the player, we will go for the simple use of a password. At the beginning of the game, every player will be
given a unique password that she will have to pass along with every call she does to the judging party's interface in order
to prove this call is coming from the player it is said it comes from.

When the judging party calls players itself, the authentication is assured as the judging party has direct pointers to every
players and those pointers cannot be tampered by the other players (as [per assumption 3][Assumptions])

### Transactions validation

When asked to perform a new transaction, the judging party will sequentially (in the order below) go through multiples steps, or checks.

At every step, if the check fails, the transaction is marked as not valid, and thus, refused.

#### 1. Players mutual agreement

For any transaction validation, the first step that the judge will follow is to ask both involved players whether they
confirm that they agree with this transaction. Both players have to answer "yes" for this check to succeed.

Note that if the transaction if a _voting transaction_ (vote casting), only the agreement of the _payer_ is being asked.
The _payee_ is not asked because you cannot _refuse_ a vote.

#### 2. Input validation
The judge will then perform rational checks. These checks are the following:

- Is the amount a **positive integer**? (avoiding resources "generation" with negative values, and rounding errors exploits
if we were to use real numbers)
- Is the amount smaller than the global amount of resources of this type in the entire game?
- If it is a delayed transaction, is the _deadline_ a valid round? ($current\ round < deadline < last\ round$ )
- In case of voting promise, is the amount smaller than the number of votes the player will be able to cast before the end 
of the game? (voting rounds multiplied by votes per player and per voting round)

#### 3. Balance check

The judge will then check the balance of the player _from_ which the transfer is going to happen for the resource that is
going to be transferred.

In the case of immediate transactions, the judge checks. The balance has to be equal or greater to the amount of the
transaction.

In the case of scheduled transactions, the judge will not check the balance, as the player could have planned to make other
agreements with other players between the round where the current transaction is being validated and the round where the
payment deadline is set.

That means that a scheduled, or delayed transaction, is not safe by itself, as the judging party cannot guarantee that the
payment will be made. Mitigation/punishment in case of lack of payment will be described later.

#### Additional virtual round for transactions validation

It should be noted that, as delayed transactions are validated at the beginning of rounds, a _virtual_ round, that is to say 
a non playable round, will be added at the end of the game for the purpose of validating the delayed transaction whose deadline
was the last round (excluding the additional virtual round).

As the game has 1,000 [rounds][gamerules], this round could be considered as the 1,001^st round.

### Casting votes aka _voting transactions_ [voting]

Casting votes is done (by the players) by returning, on the call of the judging party, a special transaction. We will call 
this type of special transaction _Voting Transaction_.

A voting transaction is an _immediate transaction_ where the resource type is always _votes_. The _payer_ is the player
casting the vote and the _payee_ is the player whose score will be increased by this vote, ie. the player "receiving" the
vote.

If the vote casting has to been linked to a delayed transaction in progress, the same process as for any other delayed
transaction will be applied: A "subtransaction" of type _Voting Subtransaction_ will be used. See [][schedtranscompletion]
for more details on _subtransactions_.

<!-- 
\vspace{1\baselineskip}
-->

Note that we also had the choice to make "votes" resource a "voting promises" resource and directly enforcing transferred amounts of
this resource by the judging party. We would do so by forcing the _payer_ player to vote less and casting automatically the _owed_
votes at the next voting round or at some voting round specified in the transaction. However, we finally decided to transform every
vote casting into a transaction so that not only we keep of every single action in the game as a transaction, allowing for logging, 
replay and potential error-recovery, but that also allows more flexible voting transactions to be created. Indeed, with our 
implementation, a player can tell another player "OK, I will for sure vote for you $X$ times before the round $r$, but I get to 
decide when". Such transactions, in a real world environment, are very important because it allows to add some preassure to some 
other  player for instance, and not to reveal one's true voting agreement too early, while still having strong voting agreements. We 
believe suchs advantages are better than the sole advantage of having the judging party to it instead of the player, that would 
prevent the player from cheating. It is to be also noted that this model allows more easily the implementation of _cancellation 
transactions_ as defined in the [future work][futurework].

### Voting rounds [votingrounds_security]

On voting rounds, the judging party will ask players to vote.

Players should vote immediately, no delay is given. Players should vote according to the rules and they should respect any
official vote promise agreement they made via a transaction.

The judging party, for every player's vote, will check that it respects the rules, and will then check that it respects vote
promises that have been registered via previous transaction. To summarise, a voting round go through the following steps, in
order:

1. Check for scheduled transaction completeness, as for any round.
2. Ask every player, one by one, to cast one vote.
3. Validate the vote according to the rules.
4. Either accept the vote, of qualify voting player as a cheater if the vote was not valid.
5. Do 3. and 4. again for the next player, until we went through all of them.
6. Publicly disclose the new number of votes that every player received and their new score.
7. Go to next round (as per [][roundsdef])

### Cheaters ban and resources owed

If, at the moment a cheater is banned, she owes some resources to another player, the remaining resources of the banned
player will be transferred to the one they were owed to, up the owed amount, and up to the remaining balance of this
resource on this banned player account.

If she owes resources to _multiple_ players. The judging party will distribute the money proportionately, rounded to the closest
integer. The exact formula is:

$$part\ of\ the\ remaining\ balance\ you\ get = round\left(\cfrac{total\ amount\ cheater\ owed\ to\ you}{total\ debt\ of\ the\ cheater}\right)$$

Where $round$ is the function that rounds a real number to the closest integer.

## Miscellaneous security measures

### Python-related security measures

As _final_ objects do not exist in Python, we have to make sure critical objects are not accessible by the players.

For instance, the judging party object is not passed to the players, only pointers to its methods. Thus, players can still
call methods of the judging party but cannot override any attribute of the judging party's instance, like resources balances,
for instance.

Another example is transactions objects. Transactions are instantiated by the player and passed to the judge. A player could
try to change the transaction object between it is validated and applied, thus making the transaction applied without having
been checked on the attributes values it holds when it is applied.

In order to mitigate this, we make a copy of the transaction passed by the player. The player thus do not have a pointer to
the object we are going to use anymore. We can then validate and apply the transaction without risks of tampering. The same
process is used when passing transactions as a parameter at the step of "player agreement" check (where we check the player
agrees with the currently being validated transaction).

{TODO: UPDATE: Classes are modifiable too, so we should not provide access to the transactions at ALL. Also, no import is allowed, so that they do not use inspection tools to trigger code execution
ALSO, they are in the own thread to make sure we can kill them and continue the game and they will not be able to hold the CPU forever}

{TODO: ADD SOMETHING ABOUT CHECKING THE NUMBER OF ROUNDS LEFT TO PREVENT PLAYERS FROM CHEATING WHEN IT IS THE LAST ROUND BY SUBMITTING A BIDIRECTIONAL TRANSACTION THAT WOULD ONLY BE EXECUTED HALF WAY}

Below is presented a gloval overview of the game. The game first initializes (cf. [_Game Initialization_][codegameinit] for more details). The game then calls the judging party and the latter is responsible for

# Coding Guidelines Comparison

## Comparison methodology

We will compare against the guidelines in the following way: we will first explain which themes of the guidelines apply
in our case and which do not, and justify why so. Then, for the guidelines that do apply, we will make our best to
define how much we respect the guidelines or not in our implementation, justified based on the security features/mechanisms
that we implemented.
<!-- 
\vspace{1\baselineskip}
-->
The complete list of guidelines themes[#coding1][] is the following:

- Secure the Weakest Link
- Practice Defense in Depth
- Fail Securely

### Application of the guidelines to our implementation

We believe the following guidelines do not apply (or not completely) in our case:

- "KISS": The KISS chapter of the guidelines is separated between how the _program itself_ should be simple and how it
should be simple _for the end user_. The _end user_ part of it is not really relevant for us as we do not really have
_users_ but more _potential attackers_ that are the players. We will thus only review the part about the _program itself_

- "Promote Privacy": This chapter is directly related to _end users_ and even more to _human beings_, it does not apply
to our  implementaiton that has Python AI code as _end user_.

- "Remember That Hiding Secrets Is Hard": Our program is both OpenSource and not compiled. Moreover, we do not use any
secret-based technique like serial or private key or seed. Moreover, this guideline is mostly about commercial-related
activites, protecting data that belongs to someone, etc. which is not really our case.

- "Be Reluctant To Trust" & "Use Your Community Resources": Those two chapters of the guidelines are entirely focused on 
off-the-shell components and libraries. They invite not to trust blindly and explain trust is transitive. They also deal
 with the fact _widely used_ software is _less likely_ to be buggy but without being a certitude. We do not use 
any external library to implement security features, thus there is not much to review about those two.

The other guidelines apply and we will directly talk about how well they are respected in details.

### Secure the Weakest Link

_Secure the Weakest Link_ theme is, according to the authors of the guidelines[#coding1][] about always targeting the
implementation of security features to protect the currently weakest link in the overall security chain. The reasonning
behind this statement is that attackers will always use the path of the least resistance when attacking a system. For
instance they will not try to break your encryption, they will just try to directly get access to a part of the system
where the information is stored unencrypted, or get access to the decryption key using social engineering for instance.

In our case, in the early stage of the implementation, the weakest link could have been said to be the "Transaction"
component/class. While the transaction object did do some checks by itself, it was prone to be tampered with (this is a
Python-specific security point: you can tamper with any object if you have access to it). When the time came to review
the current state of security in the player-to-player trade chain, we could have tried to add more sophisticated checks
to the judging party, to be able to deal with Transaction objects that would have been tampered with. But instead, the
first thing we did, was to actually sort-of _secure_ the Transactions objects. The way we did it was by keeping them in
a place where the players never actually accesses them. Then, instead of passing the players a transaction object, pass
them a built-in type ($dict$) that is isolated from the rest of the security chain. The isolation is done so that we do
not reuse the object afterwards and it has no pointers to any part of the "safe area" of the program nor any other part
of the judging party has any link to this object after it is passed to the player.

### Practice Defense in Depth [defindepth]

The summary of the _defense in depth_ in the book is that having two consecutive layers of security, which work
different ways, will hopefully allow you to block attackers that made their way through one of them, with the remaining
one.

The analogy is made with a bank. An armed guard should normally be enough to prevent someone from holding up a bank.
But, some attackers might be numerous enough or armed enough so that the guard cannot stop them. In this event, having a
second layer of security that will, for instance, prevent more than a given amout of money to be taken away, because
there are additional security requirements to get more than this amount, will likely help. Indeed, it will first stop
some attackers completely, if they are not tooled enough, for instance to break into the vault. Or in other cases it
will slow them down significantly and thus, potentially give enough time for the first level of security breach to be
detected and someone to act (in the case of the bank, for the police to come).

In our case, for instance, this has been applied to transaction validation.

Indeed, the current user is the only one who is supposed to be able to submit transactions, because it is when its
methods get run by the main loop. But if a player manages to get some CPU time outside of its own turn (by managing to
spawn a thread or using a Timer for instance), the judging party will still check for the id of the player submitting
the request, to be the current player id. The cheater will thus need to also guess the id of the current player.

In addition to this, even if the cheater bruteforces the system and finds the right current player id, the judging
party, before validating a transaction that involves a given player, will directly ask the player (direct access, no
possible impersonation/man-in-the-middle) if she is indeed OK with the transaction (even if she did submit it herself).

And, assuming the cheater is smart enough to only perform transaction that do not involve the current player, the
judging party will still ask the current player whether he is OK that the given transaction is applied on her "quota of
transactions" for the current round.

The "quota" itself is another "layer" of security. It will prevent a potential attacker that would have found a breach,
to exploit it too often, thus reducing the overall impact and slowing down the attack.

[TODO: Add something about the password authentication]

### Fail Securily [failsafe]

The idea behind "fail securely" is not much about something _to do_ but more about things _not to do_. The basic idea
is: make sure that when you end up in a failure state, you do not fall back to an unsecure mode. Examples are given
where, for instance when a client and a server software could not find any common authentication protocol, the client
would simply download a new authentication protocol from the server. Then, a rogue server could simply refuse all the
protocols a client would currently be compatible with and force the client into downloading a new authentication
protocol that is in fact a rogue one and will authenticate this server as another secure server.

In our case, such case of unsecure failure could have happened if, for instance, we were to give _reasons_ for
transactions to be refused.

More precisely, imagine if, when the "buyer" does not have the sufficient funds, we would return to the "seller" saying
"the transaction was denied because of a too low balance". We do not give the balance information here, so it seems OK,
does not it? In fact it is not. Because one could simply guess or even bisect (in case the number of tries is reduced)
the balance of the other player by submitting transactions of decreasing amounts (starting at a very high amount), until
the transaction validates or the _reason_ changes.

Having the balance information of another player is both an exploit of the system and a sort of cheating. It is an
exploit because it is not supposed to happen, and you would be the only one with this "power", which makes the game
unfair. But it also is a sort of cheating as it enables the attacker to trade with more sophisticated information,
maximizing its profit, and avoiding potentially payment defaults by not selling to players that have a too low balance.

### Follow the Principle of Least Privilege [leastpriv]

The "least privilege principle" is a reknown paradigm in security, not only in computer science: Even if you have the
highest level of trust in a person, if you give him or her more privileges than he/she needs, you are putting yourself
at higher risks than if you did not. Indeed, even if you are giving the key of your house, to feed the pets while you
are in vacation, to your life-long best friend, the probability that something unwanted happens in your house is not
zero.

That could even be indirectly your friend's fault. He could loose the keys. And if you had isolated your pets into the
garage and only given the garage's key to your friend. Then nobody could enter the house (except the garage). We will by
the way see that the _compartmentalize_ guideline presented later on makes it easier to apply this principle.

In our case, the principle can be applied in many different places.

The first place is for instance the player resources balance. As the player has the starting amount of resources passed
to him at the beginning of the game, the player does not need to have any additional information about the balance. We
could have had an access control system in order to allow users to read this information but not write it, but that
would have been against the principle of the least privilege: here, the players do not need read access to this
information, so we do not give it to them.

Another good example, that follows the analogy of the house, is the ability to call the judging party. One could have
thought of passing the judging party's object to the players at the beginning. They could then be able to talk to him as
they have a reference to him. But this is much more privileges than necessary. What do the players need? They need
access to specific methods of the judging party's object. Then, we only give them access to those specific methods: we
export the methods pointers and give these to the player. So the player has access to the method, not the entire object,
the same way your friend should only have access to the pet area and not the entire house.

The same principle is applied when asking for agreement over the transactions: what do players need in the end? They do
not need a Transaction object, they simply need the data that the object is carrying: amounts, delays, type of
transaction... So we generate a dictionary that contains this data for easy access and the player is only given this.

### Compartmentalize [compartment]

Compartmentalize is described in the guidelines[#coding1][] as a way to limit the amount of damage that can be dealt to
a system when an attacker breaks in. This is in some points similar to [defense in depth][defindepth]. We will also see
in the next guideline (KISS) that it can be in conflict with it sometimes.

Take the analogy of the pet-sitter previously described again: so you have decided that you will not give more privilege
than necessary to the pet-sitter. Thus you want to give him or her only access to an area where your pets are confined.
Even if your pets are in the garage, if you do not have a separate entrance and lock for the garage, the pet-sitter
will still need to go through the house in order to get there, thus making it impossible to give him or her only the
least possible privileges.

The basic idea here is to try to break the program down into the smallest viable independant parts. Once this is done,
it is easier to only give permission to access the parts that should be accessed and not to the parts that are not
supposed to be accessed.

Compartmentalization is only useful if you have multiple roles, though. Indeed, if everyone always needs access to all
compartments anyway, then this does not change much.

This guideline thus does not apply much to our implementation. Indeed the only role we have (for external entities) is
the one of "player". All players need the same access and there is not much compartmentalization that can be done.

[TODO: Review this spacing at the end, when the document is fully finalized]
<!--

We could, though, maybe consider that for instance, we could have compartmentalized the judging party into several 
different entities:

- A transaction validator
- A player manager

Those two parts (except some parts of the transaction validation) are basically handled, or accessible and directly
manipulated, by the judging party. But the fact that Python allows all sorts of manipulation to objects you have
reference to would have made it quite hard anyway to have those two entities communicate with each other synchroneously
without providing, to an attacker that would have got access to one of them, access to the other one.

### Keep It Simple, Stupid! (KISS) [kiss]

The KISS principle is reknown outside of security too. The KISS principle is more or less composed in some parts, of
tautology: if you increase the complexity of your program, you increase the risk of bugs. This is pretty obvious, as one
could argue that bugs have a probability to appear for every line of code.

The guidelines explain that in terms of security, one of the ways the KISS principle can manifest itself is into
concentrating security-critical operations in a small number of _choke points_. This will create a small, easily
controlled interface where everything has to go through. The analogy is performed with a stadium: the more entrances
there are, the more complicated it gets to perform high quality control on absolutely everyone.

The balance between KISS and compartmentalized/defense in depth is that we should break things down into smaller chunks
and/or provide several layers of security up to a point where the system still remains simple enough. "Simple enough"
being the hard part to define and unfortunately there are no secret general recipes for that.

In our implementation the choke point can indeed be considered as the judging party: by having a centralized interface
through which every player has to go in order to communicate with another player, we avoid the need to control several
channels of communication with their own specificities and/or security implications each.

The second part of the KISS principle as described in the guidelines explains how _end users_ (human beings) should have
a simple enough secure system because they will not deal with security themselves. We are not really concerned about
this part though as we do not really have any users but we could argue that we have only attackers: indeed, the goal of
the players is to win the game and, cheating is one of the ways to achieve that, thus, one of the actions players should
try to perform is cheating.


# Future work: Game complexification

The following parts and/or rules of the game and/or previous decisions could be changed in order to make the game a little 
bit more complex but a little bit more realistic in some way:

- When a cheater is banned, do distribution of the cheater's remaining resources so that we try to minimize the amount of 
debts remaining open or so that we minimize the dissatisfaction of the loaners.
- Allowing _cancellation transactions_ (together with a _refund_) for _delayed_ transactions. E.g.: a player finally does 
not want to give that many votes to another player, so she asks for cancellation and proposes a given amount as a refund for 
the cancelling of the "contract". As any other transaction, both players would need to agree. The judging party would then 
simply _discard_ the remaining open delayed transaction upon applying the _cancellation transaction_.
- Give players an interface to declare the tradable resources they have to the judging party. It would allow to model real life 
trade where businesses might have exclusive resources that they are alone to possess, compared to everyone trading the same resources.
- Introducting loyalty and trust "resources".

The same way as for the guidelines, if we get additional time we will look into those issues first.

those suggestions in the review comments.
